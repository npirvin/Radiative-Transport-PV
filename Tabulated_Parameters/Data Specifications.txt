***Spectrums***
Gives energy-resolved sunlight intensity.
The first column is energies in eV, and second column is wavelength in nm.
n_per_nm is spectral photocurrent in s^-1*m^-2*nm^-1. n_per_eV is spectral photocurrent in s^-1*m^-2*eV^-1.
E_per_nm is spectral irradiance in W*m^-2*nm^-1. E_per_eV is spectral irradiance in W*m^-2*eV^-1.
The prefix 'G' is for global sunlight, which is direct and indirect, so use this for unconcentrated light. The prefix 'D' is for direct sunlight only, so use this for concentrated sunlight or angularly-selective filters.
The first set of data is ASTM173-03 from 2012. Miller and King use this data set.
The second set of data, prefixed '2008', is IEC 60904-3-Ed2 global sunlight from 2008. Richter uses this data set.
The third set of data, prefixed "0", stands for AM0.
To get efficiencies in stack_power.py, divide output power by Pin where Pin = 1000.37 + 2.53 (W/m^2) for 'G' data, 998 + 2.53 for '2008_G', and 900.14 + 2.53 for 'D'. 2.53 W/m^2 is the power outside of the tabulated data.
To convert per eV to per nm, go through: dP/dW(m)= dP/dE(J)*E(J)/dW(m).
